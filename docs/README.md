# Bucket Website Source

Within this folder we store the latest website.
Note that in this branch the generated dist files are ignored,
but are not ignored in the `pages` branch.

Despite being called docs, it really is just the generated elm website and app.
Only reason it is called docs is because GitHub pages can only work with the root
or docs folder.
